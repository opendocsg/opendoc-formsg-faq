# SingPass, CorpPass and MyInfo

## How do you enable SingPass or CorpPass?

All you have to do is enter an e-service ID on the Settings tab of your form to enable SPCP:

An e-service ID is a unique billing ID given by the SingPass/CorpPass office to your department's finance team. An invalid e-service ID will yield a 138 error for SingPass and 328 error for CorpPass. If you donâ€™t already have an e-service ID, you can either ask your agency IT department to find an e-service ID to reuse, or contact SPCP rep [alvin_wee@tech.gov.sg](mailto:alvin_wee@tech.gov.sg) to create a new one. When testing your e-service ID you may log in to our UAT server, https://uat.form.gov.sg and create test forms there. Note that accounts and forms are separate on UAT and Live servers and cannot be transferred over.

To track number of submissions at your e-service ID you may visit the Billing Panel tab on the top right of your forms dashboard:

It is up to you to decide if you want 2FA or 1FA e-service ID. For CorpPass, it is also up to you to decide whether you want authorisation work flows at your e-service ID. Consult SPCP rep on this if you have concerns.
