# READ THIS FIRST

This is a 5 minute read that helps you understand most of the in-and-outs of FormSG.

## What is FormSG?

FormSG is a self-service form builder for government to create online forms that capture classified data, with the goal of replacing paper forms. Since it began in September 2017, it has replaced tens of thousands of paper forms and are used by over 90 agencies such as MOM, MOE, PA,  SportSG and TTSH. More than 25,000 officers are already on it. It has advanced features and can be used for not just simple surveys but also complicated workflow forms.

## Who can use FormSG?

FormSG is built for the public sector and public healthcare clusters. There is no onboarding process. Simply [log in](https://form.gov.sg/#!/signin) with your agency email (e.g. @tech.gov.sg). FormSG works on both Internet and the WOG Intranet.

## How does FormSG keep my data secure?

Unlike most form builders out there, FormSG does not store your data. This means if our database is breached, there is no raw data to hack. There are two secure modes of creating forms.

Email mode: Form responses are sent directly into your specified email(s), and our server never stores a copy of it. Because we do not store responses, it is critical your mailbox is correctly specified and has space, or responses will be lost.

Storage mode (Coming End Apr 2020): Responses are stored, but end-to-end encrypted. On form creation, private key is generated on the client and never seen by our server. On form submission, response is encrypted on the client first, before being sent to our server for storage.

## My form responses are lost! Can you help us recover them?

Because we do not store data, we cannot recover your lost data. If you cannot find your email responses, they might have been routed to an obscure Outlook folder set by your mail forwarding rules. Or they might have been quarantined by your agency firewall, which you can contact your AFM/IT department for. If you accidentally delete your email responses, they might still be on the email server, which you should contact your AFM/IT department for help.

## Is FormSG IM8 / AIAS / DSS compliant?

Yes we are compliant with IM8, AIAS policy, and DSS. If you have concerns on our compliance, kindly contact us via our [Support Form](https://go.gov.sg/formsg-support), and mention the specific clause you have concerns on.

## Is FormSG really free?

Yes, officers can build any number of forms to collect any number of submissions for free. 

The only exception is having to pay for SingPass or CorpPass authentication. If your agency has a high volume of SPCP transactions each month, the price per login can be low. At the base tier, the price of SPCP is about $0.25 per login, with a fixed fee of about $2,000/month. We won't be able to advise you on the latest pricing info, and you should contact SPCP rep [alvin_wee@tech.gov.sg](mailto:alvin_wee@tech.gov.sg) for it.

## How do you enable SingPass or CorpPass?

All you have to do is enter an e-service ID on the Settings tab of your form to enable SPCP:

![FormSG FAQ E-service ID](https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/misc.form.gov.sg/faq-singpass.png "FormSG FAQ E-service ID")

An e-service ID is a unique billing ID given by the SingPass/CorpPass office to your department's finance team. An invalid e-service ID will yield a 138 error for SingPass and 328 error for CorpPass. If you donâ€™t already have an e-service ID, you can either ask your agency IT department to find an e-service ID to reuse, or contact SPCP rep [alvin_wee@tech.gov.sg](mailto:alvin_wee@tech.gov.sg) to create a new one. When testing your e-service ID you may log in to our UAT server, https://uat.form.gov.sg and create test forms there. Note that accounts and forms are separate on UAT and Live servers and cannot be transferred over.

To track number of submissions at your e-service ID you may visit the Billing Panel tab on the top right of your forms dashboard:

![FormSG FAQ Billing Panel E-service ID](https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/misc.form.gov.sg/faq-billing-eservice.png "FormSG FAQ Billing Panel E-service ID")

It is up to you to decide if you want 2FA or 1FA e-service ID. For CorpPass, it is also up to you to decide whether you want authorisation work flows at your e-service ID. Consult SPCP rep on this if you have concerns. 

## Is FormSG really up 24/7?

Yes, we are up 24/7. There is no planned maintenance window. Typically once a few months we have a 2 hour maintenance window from 12am - 2am, but most features are constantly deployed without downtime. Because we do not charge for the service we do not have an SLA, but have a measured uptime of 99.999% since we launched. The exception is SingPass and CorpPass, which do have planned maintenance, with which you can contact SPCP rep [alvin_wee@tech.gov.sg](mailto:alvin_wee@tech.gov.sg) to find out more.

## How am I informed of issues on my form?

We have multiple tests and detection tools to flag issues on forms. If we detect an issue with your form we will email you. Although rare, if the entire platform has downtime, we will announce it on Workplace@Facebook, and enable a maintenance page on all forms. We have engineers on-call 24/7 to react to issues as fast as we can. If there are issues with your form, you can contact us through our [Support Form](https://go.gov.sg/formsg-support).

## What data classification (RCST) can FormSG handle?

On Email mode, FormSG can handle up to Restricted per entry, and Confidential for the collection of data. This is because FormSG is a Restricted system that can manage Restricted data flowing through it, but ultimately data is stored in your government email, or SGMail, which is a Confidential system that lets you store Confidential collections of data. If however you specify a non-government email to send responses to, then you are not recommended to accept data that is classified Confidential.

On Storage mode, FormSG can handle up to Restricted. 

## What information sensitivity (ISF) can FormSG handle?

FormSG's email mode has in-principle approval from SNDGO, the policy owner, that it can support Sensitive High data. 

FormSG's storage mode has similar approval for Sensitive Normal, and is still undergoing review for Sensitive High.
