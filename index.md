# FormSG - User Guide

FormSG is self-service and typically does not need a guide. The best way to learn about the service is to [log in](https://form.gov.sg/#!/signin) and create your first form. 

We also have a constantly updated deck of slides for you to share with your peers: [https://go.gov.sg/formsg-sharing-slides](https://go.gov.sg/formsg-sharing-slides)

There are three sections in this guide:
- Basic Guide is for new users 
- Advanced Guide contains tips and tricks and workarounds to common issues. If you have tips of your own to share, we're all ears. You may visit our Github repository and update our guide directly (instructions for how to do this are also in the Advanced Guide).
- Updates is a summary of new FormSG developments and releases
