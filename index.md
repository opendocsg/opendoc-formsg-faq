# Form.gov.sg User Guide

Form.gov.sg is self-service and typically does not need a guide. The best way to learn about the service is to [log in](https://form.gov.sg/#!/signin) and create your first form. 

We also have a constantly updated deck of slides for you to share with your peers: [https://go.gov.sg/formsg-sharing-slides](https://go.gov.sg/formsg-sharing-slides)

There are three sections in this user guide:
- **Basic Guide** is a 5-min introduction for new users 
- **Advanced Guide** contains tips and tricks on FormSG features and options, and workarounds to common issues. If you have tips of your own to share, we're all ears. You may visit our Github repository and update our guide directly (instructions for how to do this are also in the Advanced Guide).
- **What's New** for all the latest features and improvements
