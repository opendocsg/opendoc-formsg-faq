# Form User Guide

[Form.gov.sg](https://form.gov.sg/#!/signin) is self-service, and designed for first-time users to pick up quickly without an onboarding guide. The best way to learn about this handy tool is to [log in](https://form.gov.sg/#!/signin) and create your first form. 

There are three sections in this user guide:
- **Basic Guide** is a 5-min introduction for new users
- **Advanced Guide** contains tips and tricks on FormSG features and options, and workarounds to common issues. If you have tips of your own to share, we're all ears. You may visit our Github repository and update our guide directly (instructions for how to do this are also in the Advanced Guide).
- **Feature Roadmap** for our latest features and product roadmap
